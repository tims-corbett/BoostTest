function matlab_figures_to_word_document
%This program converts a Matlab Figure File with a title to Word Document
%through ActiveX Control. The program is designed for a figure with a
%single graph with a title.  It converts the graph title to an array,
%deletes the title, copies the figure to the clipboard, pastes the
%clipboard contents to the Word Document, and writes the title as text
%beneath the figure.  The program can operate in two modes:
%	1.	Single file - Use Lines 12 through 15
%	2.	All files in a directory - Use Lines 16 through 25
%
%The program is currently designed for two lines of text, but more can be
%added by copying and pasting the four lines of code that write text and
%adjusting the subscript numbers.  The program could also be adjusted to
%handle a single-line title by deleting the code that writes the second
%line of the title.  The title in the Word Document will also contain
%today's date, but that can be changed by deleting the appropriate code.
%
%At present, the program only creates new files.

%Operate on just one file
	%[filename pathname] = uigetfile('*.fig', 'Select file to open');
		%full_name = [pathname filename];
	%create_word_figure(full_name);
%Get entire directory
	pathname = uigetdir;
	file_directory = dir([pathname '\*.fig']);
		num_files = length(file_directory);
	%Get individual files
	for k = 1:num_files
		filename = file_directory(k,1).name;
		full_name = [pathname '\' filename];
		create_word_figure(full_name);
	end
