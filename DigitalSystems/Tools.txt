Dynamic Fault Tree (DFT)

+ Dependency gates
- Quantification: Boolean logic or Markov models
- Cutsets may change with system evolution in time



Dynamic Flowgrapgh Methodology (DFM)

- Uses Decision Tables (state transitions)
+ Digrapgh approach
+ Uses physical process vars (hardware)
- Cannot accurately quantify dependencies between failure events
+ http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/safir2010/vasenpalkki/interim2009/charisma_karanta.pdf
+ Nodes: Variables (Water level, Valve position)
+ Nodes have discrete states (High, Stationary, Low)
+ Edges: Dependencies
+ Multiple top-events
- No Systematic modelling methods
- Heavy computational demand
- Combinatorial explosion
+ Physical properties and Software behaviour


Petri nets

-Graph theoretic
-Quantification: Simulation
-Size of the model
+Can be converted to fault trees




Why SMP

- Require highly time dependent plant info
- Digital failure data generation is problematic


Traditional Fault Trees

- Sequential vs. Functional failures
- Spares, Dynamic Redundancies
- Priority of failure events
