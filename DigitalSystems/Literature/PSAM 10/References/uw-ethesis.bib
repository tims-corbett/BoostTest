This paper investigates the rate of occurrence of failures (ROCOF) of finite state semi-Markov systems. Firstly, a formula for evaluating the ROCOF for semi-Markov systems is derived. As a consequence of this result, we derive the ROCOF of Markov systems as well as the ROCOF of the alternating renewal processes and we give their asymptotic values. From the semi-Markov ROCOF formula, we propose a statistical estimator of this function. Finally, the uniform strong consistency and the asymptotic normality of this estimator are obtained."

Traditional fault tree (FT) analysis is widely used for reliability and safety assessment of complex and critical engineering systems. The behavior of components of complex systems and their interactions such as sequence- and functional-dependent failures, spares and dynamic redundancy management, and priority of failure events cannot be adequately captured by traditional FTs. Dynamic fault tree (DFT) extend traditional FT by defining additional gates called dynamic gates to model these complex interactions. Markov models are used in solving dynamic gates. However, state space becomes too large for calculation with Markov models when the number of gate inputs increases. In addition, Markov model is applicable for only exponential failure and repair distributions. Modeling test and maintenance information on spare components is also very difficult. To address these difficulties, Monte Carlo simulation-based approach is used in this work to solve dynamic gates. The approach is first applied to a problem available in the literature which is having non-repairable components. The obtained results are in good agreement with those in literature. The approach is later applied to a simplified scheme of electrical power supply system of nuclear power plant (NPP), which is a complex repairable system having tested and maintained spares. The results obtained using this approach are in good agreement with those obtained using analytical approach. In addition to point estimates of reliability measures, failure time, and repair time distributions are also obtained from simulation. Finally a case study on reactor regulation system (RRS) of NPP is carried out to demonstrate the application of simulation-based DFT approach to large-scale problems."

The recent trend in deploying communication networks in digital control systems to form Networked Control Systems (NCSs) brings the need for utilizing dynamic methods to assess the reliability of these systems. The methods should be able to capture the behaviour and interaction of the hardware, the software and the communication network in the NCSs. They should also be able to incorporate time dependency and multi-state behaviour. In this paper, it is demonstrated how the Dynamic Flowgraph Methodology (DFM) can be a promising method to fulfill these requirements. The behaviour and the effect of the communication network on NCS performance is emphasized. The information provided by analysis of the implemented model facilitates the improvement of the control system performance."

This paper presents an application of stochastic Petri nets (SPN) to calculate the availability of safety critical on-demand systems. Traditional methods of estimating system reliability include standards--based or field return-based reliability prediction methods. These methods do not take into account the effect of fault-detection capability and penalize the addition of detection circuitry due to the higher parts count. Therefore, calculating system availability, which can be linked to the system's probability of failure on demand (Pfd), can be a better alternative to reliability prediction. The process of estimating the Pfd of a safety system can be further complicated by the presence of system imperfections such as partial-fault detection by users and untimely or uncompleted repairs. Additionally, most system failures cannot be represented by Poisson process Markov chain methods, which are commonly utilized for the purposes of estimating Pfd, as these methods are not well-suited for the analysis of non-Poisson failures. This paper suggests a methodology and presents a case study of SPN modeling adequately handling most of the above problems. The model will be illustrated with a case study of an automotive electronics airbag controller as an example of a safety critical on-demand system."
